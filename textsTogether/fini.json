she hotter that did lookFor his approach, that often there had been.Anon he comes, and throws his mantle by,And stood stark naked on the brook's green brim:The sun look'd on the world with glorious eye,Yet not so wistly as this queen on him.He, spying her, bounced in, whereas he stood:'O Jove,' quoth she, 'why was not I a flood!'VII.Fair is my love, but not so fair as fickle;Mild as a dove, but neither true nor trusty;Brighter than glass, and yet, as glass is brittle;Softer than wax, and yet, as iron, rusty:A lily pale, with damask dye to grace her,None fairer, nor none falser to deface her.Her lips to mine how often hath she joined,Between each kiss her oaths of true love swearing!How many tales to please me bath she coined,Dreading my love, the loss thereof still fearing!Yet in the midst of all her pure protestings,Her faith, her oaths, her tears, and all were jestings.She burn'd with love, as straw with fire flameth;She burn'd out love, as soon as straw outburneth;She framed the love, and yet she foil'd the framing;She bade love last, and yet she fell a-turning.Was this a lover, or a lecher whether?Bad in the best, though excellent in neither.VIII.If music and sweet poetry agree,As they must needs, the sister and the brother,Then must the love be great 'twixt thee and me,Because thou lovest the one, and I the other.Dowland to thee is dear, whose heavenly touchUpon the lute doth ravish human sense;Spenser to me, whose deep conceit is suchAs, passing all conceit, needs no defence.Thou lovest to bear the sweet melodious soundThat Phoebus' lute, the queen of music, makes;And I in deep delight am chiefly drown'dWhenas himself to singing he betakes.One god is god of both, as poets feign;One knight loves both, and both in thee remain.IX.Fair was the morn when the fair queen of love,Paler for sorrow than her milk-white dove,For Adon's sake, a youngster proud and wild;Her stand she takes upon a steep-up hill:Anon Adonis comes with horn and hounds;She, silly queen, with more than love's good will,Forbade the boy he should not pass those grounds:'Once,' quoth she, 'did I see a fair sweet youthHere in these brakes deep-wounded with a boar,Deep in the thigh, a spectacle of ruth!See, in my thigh,' quoth she, 'here was the sore.She showed hers: he saw more wounds than one,And blushing fled, and left her all alone.X.Sweet rose, fair flower, untimely pluck'd, soon vaded,Pluck'd in the bud, and vaded in the spring!Bright orient pearl, alack, too timely shaded!Fair creature, kill'd too soon by death's sharp sting!Like a green plum that hangs upon a tree,And falls, through wind, before the fall should he.I weep for thee, and yet no cause I have;For why thou left'st me nothing in thy will:And yet thou left'st me more than I did crave;For why I craved nothing of thee still:O yes, dear friend, I pardon crave of thee,Thy discontent thou didst bequeath to me.XI.Venus, with young Adonis sitting by herUnder a myrtle shade, began to woo him:She told the youngling how god Mars did try her,And as he fell to her, so fell she to him.'Even thus,' quoth she, 'the warlike god embraced me,'And then she clipp'd Adonis in her arms;'Even thus,' quoth she, 'the warlike god unlaced me,'As if the boy should use like loving charms;'Even thus,' quoth she, 'he seized on my lipsAnd with her lips on his did act the seizureAnd as she fetched breath, away he skips,And would not take her meaning nor her pleasure.Ah, that I had my lady at this bay,To kiss and clip me till I run away!XII.Crabbed age and youth cannot live togetherYouth is full of pleasance, age is full of care;Youth like summer morn, age like winter weather;Youth like summer brave, age like winter bare;Youth is full of sport, age's breath is short;Youth is nimble, age is lame;Youth is hot and bold, age is weak and cold;Youth is wild, and age is tame.Age, I do abhor thee; youth, I do adore thee;O, my love, my love is young!Age, I do defy thee: O, sweet shepherd, hie thee,For methinks thou stay'st too long.XIII.Beauty is but a vain and doubtful good;A shining gloss that vadeth suddenly;A flower that dies when first it gins to bud;A brittle glass that's broken presently:A doubtful good, a gloss, a glass, a flower,Lost, vaded, broken, dead within an hour.And as goods lost are seld or never found,As vaded gloss no rubbing will refresh,As flowers dead lie wither'd on the ground,As broken glass no cement can redress,So beauty blemish'd once's for ever lost,In spite of physic, painting, pain and cost.XIV.Good night, good rest. Ah, neither be my share:She bade good night that kept my rest away;And daff'd me to a cabin hang'd with care,To descant on the doubts of my decay.'Farewell,' quoth she, 'and come again tomorrow:Fare well I could not, for I supp'd with sorrow.Yet at my parting sweetly did she smile,In scorn or friendship, nill I construe whether:'T may be, she joy'd to jest at my exile,'T may be, again to make me wander thither:'Wander,' a word for shadows like myself,As take the pain, but cannot pluck the pelf.XV.Lord, how mine eyes throw gazes to the east!My heart doth charge the watch; the morning riseDoth cite each moving sense from idle rest.Not daring trust the office of mine eyes,While Philomela sits and sings, I sit and mark,And wish her lays were tuned like the lark;For she doth welcome daylight with her ditty,And drives away dark dismal-dreaming night:The night so pack'd, I post unto my pretty;Heart hath his hope, and eyes their wished sight;Sorrow changed to solace, solace mix'd with sorrow;For why, she sigh'd and bade me come tomorrow.Were I with her, the night would post too soon;But now are minutes added to the hours;To spite me now, each minute seems a moon;Yet not for me, shine sun to succour flowers!Pack night, peep day; good day, of night now borrow:Short, night, to-night, and length thyself tomorrow. \n                        \n                    ",

love's best habit is in seeming trust,And age in love, loves not to have years told:Therefore I lie with her, and she with me,And in our faults by lies we flattered be.CXXXIXO! call not me to justify the wrongThat thy unkindness lays upon my heart;Wound me not with thine eye, but with thy tongue:Use power with power, and slay me not by art,Tell me thou lov'st elsewhere; but in my sight,Dear heart, forbear to glance thine eye aside:What need'st thou wound with cunning, when thy mightIs more than my o'erpressed defence can bide?Let me excuse thee: ah! my love well knowsHer pretty looks have been mine enemies;And therefore from my face she turns my foes,That they elsewhere might dart their injuries:Yet do not so; but since I am near slain,Kill me outright with looks, and rid my pain.CXLBe wise as thou art cruel; do not pressMy tongue-tied patience with too much disdain;Lest sorrow lend me words, and words expressThe manner of my pity-wanting pain.If I might teach thee wit, better it were,Though not to love, yet, love to tell me so;As testy sick men, when their deaths be near,No news but health from their physicians know;For, if I should despair, I should grow mad,And in my madness might speak ill of thee;Now this ill-wresting world is grown so bad,Mad slanderers by mad ears believed be.That I may not be so, nor thou belied,Bear thine eyes straight, though thy proud heart go wide.CXLIIn faith I do not love thee with mine eyes,For they in thee a thousand errors note;But 'tis my heart that loves what they despise,Who, in despite of view, is pleased to dote.Nor are mine ears with thy tongue's tune delighted;Nor tender feeling, to base touches prone,Nor taste, nor smell, desire to be invitedTo any sensual feast with thee alone:But my five wits nor my five senses canDissuade one foolish heart from serving thee,Who leaves unswayed the likeness of a man,Thy proud heart's slave and vassal wretch to be:Only my plague thus far I count my gain,That she that makes me sin awards me pain.CXLIILove is my sin, and thy dear virtue hate,Hate of my sin, grounded on sinful loving:O! but with mine compare thou thine own state,And thou shalt find it merits not reproving;Or, if it do, not from those lips of thine,That have profaned their scarlet ornamentsAnd sealed false bonds of love as oft as mine,Robbed others' beds' revenues of their rents.Be it lawful I love thee, as thou lov'st thoseWhom thine eyes woo as mine importune thee:Root pity in thy heart, that, when it grows,Thy pity may deserve to pitied be.If thou dost seek to have what thou dost hide,By self-example mayst thou be denied!CXLIIILo, as a careful housewife runs to catchOne of her feather'd creatures broke away,Sets down her babe, and makes all swift dispatchIn pursuit of the thing she would have stay;Whilst her neglected child holds her in chase,Cries to catch her whose busy care is bentTo follow that which flies before her face,Not prizing her poor infant's discontent;So runn'st thou after that which flies from thee,Whilst I thy babe chase thee afar behind;But if thou catch thy hope, turn back to me,And play the mother's part, kiss me, be kind;So will I pray that thou mayst have thy 'Will,'If thou turn back and my loud crying still.CXLIVTwo loves I have of comfort and despair,Which like two spirits do suggest me still:The better angel is a man right fair,The worser spirit a woman coloured ill.To win me soon to hell, my female evil,Tempteth my better angel from my side,And would corrupt my saint to be a devil,Wooing his purity with her foul pride.And whether that my angel be turned fiend,Suspect I may, yet not directly tell;But being both from me, both to each friend,I guess one angel in another's hell:Yet this shall I ne'er know, but live in doubt,Till my bad angel fire my good one out.CXLVThose lips that Love's own hand did make,Breathed forth the sound that said 'I hate',To me that languished for her sake:But when she saw my woeful state,Straight in her heart did mercy come,Chiding that tongue that ever sweetWas used in giving gentle doom;And taught it thus anew to greet;'I hate' she altered with an end,That followed it as gentle day,Doth follow night, who like a fiendFrom heaven to hell is flown away.'I hate', from hate away she threw,And saved my life, saying 'not you'.CXLVIPoor soul, the centre of my sinful earth,( ??? ) these rebel powers that thee array,Why dost thou pine within and suffer dearth,Painting thy outward walls so costly gay?Why so large cost, having so short a lease,Dost thou upon thy fading mansion spend?Shall worms, inheritors of this excess,Eat up thy charge? Is this thy body's end?Then soul, live thou upon thy servant's loss,And let that pine to aggravate thy store;Buy terms divine in selling hours of dross;Within be fed, without be rich no more:So shall thou feed on Death, that feeds on men,And Death once dead, there's no more dying then.CXLVIIMy love is as a fever longing still,For that which longer nurseth the disease;Feeding on that which doth preserve the ill,The uncertain sickly appetite to please.My reason, the physician to my love,Angry that his prescriptions are not kept,Hath left me, and I desperate now approveDesire is death, which physic did except.Past cure I am, now Reason is past care,And frantic-mad with evermore unrest;My thoughts and my discourse as madmen's are,At random from the truth vainly expressed;For I have sworn thee fair, and thought thee bright,Who art as black as hell, as dark as night.CXLVIIIO me! what eyes hath Love put in my head,Which have no correspondence with true sight;Or, if they have, where is my judgment fled,That censures falsely what they see aright?If that be fair whereon my false eyes dote,What means the world to say it is not so?If it be not, then love doth well denoteLove's eye is not so true as all men's: no,How can it? O! how can Love's eye be true,That is so vexed with watching and with tears?No marvel then, though I mistake my view;The sun itself sees not, till heaven clears.O cunning Love! with tears thou keep'st me blind,Lest eyes well-seeing thy foul faults should find.CXLIXCanst thou, O cruel! say I love thee not,When I against myself with thee partake?Do I not think on thee, when I forgotAm of my self, all tyrant, for thy sake?Who hateth thee that I do call my friend,On whom frown'st thou that I do fawn upon,Nay, if thou lour'st on me, do I not spendRevenge upon myself with present moan?What merit do I in my self respect,That is so proud thy service to despise,When all my best doth worship thy defect,Commanded by the motion of thine eyes?But, love, hate on, for now I know thy mind,Those that can see thou lov'st, and I am blind.CLO! from what power hast thou this powerful might,With insufficiency my heart to sway?To make me give the lie to my true sight,And swear that brightness doth not grace the day?Whence hast thou this becoming of things ill,That in the very refuse of thy deedsThere is such strength and warrantise of skill,That, in my mind, thy worst all best exceeds?Who taught thee how to make me love thee more,The more I hear and see just cause of hate?O! though I love what others do abhor,With others thou shouldst not abhor my state:If thy unworthiness raised love in me,More worthy I to be beloved of thee.CLILove is too young to know what conscience is,Yet who knows not conscience is born of love?Then, gentle cheater, urge not my amiss,Lest guilty of my faults thy sweet self prove:For, thou betraying me, I do betrayMy nobler part to my gross body's treason;My soul doth tell my body that he mayTriumph in love; flesh stays no farther reason,But rising at thy name doth point out thee,As his triumphant prize. Proud of this pride,He is contented thy poor drudge to be,To stand in thy affairs, fall by thy side.No want of conscience hold it that I callHer love, for whose dear love I rise and fall.CLIIIn loving thee thou know'st I am forsworn,But thou art twice forsworn, to me love swearing;In act thy bed-vow broke, and new faith torn,In vowing new hate after new love bearing:But why of two oaths' breach do I accuse thee,When I break twenty? I am perjured most;For all my vows are oaths but to misuse thee,And all my honest faith in thee is lost:For I have sworn deep oaths of thy deep kindness,Oaths of thy love, thy truth, thy constancy;And, to enlighten thee, gave eyes to blindness,Or made them swear against the thing they see;For I have sworn thee fair; more perjured eye,To swear against the truth so foul a lie!CLIIICupid laid by his brand and fell asleep:A maid of Dian's this advantage found,And his love-kindling fire did quickly steepIn a cold valley-fountain of that ground;Which borrowed from this holy fire of Love,A dateless lively heat, still to endure,And grew a seething bath, which yet men proveAgainst strange maladies a sovereign cure.But at my mistress' eye Love's brand new-fired,The boy for trial needs would touch my breast;I, sick withal, the help of bath desired,And thither hied, a sad distempered guest,But found no cure, the bath for my help liesWhere Cupid got new fire; my mistress' eyes.CLIVThe little Love-god lying once asleep,Laid by his side his heart-inflaming brand,Whilst many nymphs that vowed chaste life to keepCame tripping by; but in her maiden handThe fairest votary took up that fireWhich many legions of true hearts had warmed;And so the General of hot desireWas, sleeping, by a virgin hand disarmed.This brand she quenched in a cool well by,Which from Love's fire took heat perpetual,Growing a bath and healthful remedy,For men diseased; but I, my mistress' thrall,Came there for cure and this by that I prove,Love's fire heats water, water cools not love. \n                        \n                    ",

IVUnthrifty loveliness, why dost thou spendUpon thy self thy beauty's legacy?Nature's bequest gives nothing, but doth lend,And being frank she lends to those are free:Then, beauteous niggard, why dost thou abuseThe bounteous largess given thee to give?Profitless usurer, why dost thou useSo great a sum of sums, yet canst not live?For having traffic with thy self alone,Thou of thy self thy sweet self dost deceive:Then how when nature calls thee to be gone,What acceptable audit canst thou leave?Thy unused beauty must be tombed with thee,Which, used, lives th' executor to be. VThose hours, that with gentle work did frameThe lovely gaze where every eye doth dwell,Will play the tyrants to the very sameAnd that unfair which fairly doth excel;For never-resting time leads summer onTo hideous winter, and confounds him there;Sap checked with frost, and lusty leaves quite gone,Beauty o'er-snowed and bareness every where:Then were not summer's distillation left,A liquid prisoner pent in walls of glass,Beauty's effect with beauty were bereft,Nor it, nor no remembrance what it was:But flowers distill'd, though they with winter meet,Leese but their show; their substance still lives sweet. VIThen let not winter's ragged hand deface,In thee thy summer, ere thou be distilled:Make sweet some vial; treasure thou some placeWith beauty's treasure ere it be self-killed.That use is not forbidden usury,Which happies those that pay the willing loan;That's for thy self to breed another thee,Or ten times happier, be it ten for one;Ten times thy self were happier than thou art,If ten of thine ten times refigured thee:Then what could death do if thou shouldst depart,Leaving thee living in posterity?Be not self-willed, for thou art much too fairTo be death's conquest and make worms thine heir. VIILo! in the orient when the gracious lightLifts up his burning head, each under eyeDoth homage to his new-appearing sight,Serving with looks his sacred majesty;And having climbed the steep-up heavenly hill,Resembling strong youth in his middle age,Yet mortal looks adore his beauty still,Attending on his golden pilgrimage:But when from highmost pitch, with weary car,Like feeble age, he reeleth from the day,The eyes, 'fore duteous, now converted areFrom his low tract, and look another way:So thou, thyself outgoing in thy noonUnlooked on diest unless thou get a son. VIIIMusic to hear, why hear'st thou music sadly?Sweets with sweets war not, joy delights in joy:Why lov'st thou that which thou receiv'st not gladly,Or else receiv'st with pleasure thine annoy?If the true concord of well-tuned sounds,By unions married, do offend thine ear,They do but sweetly chide thee, who confoundsIn singleness the parts that thou shouldst bear.Mark how one string, sweet husband to another,Strikes each in each by mutual ordering;Resembling sire and child and happy mother,Who, all in one, one pleasing note do sing:Whose speechless song being many, seeming one,Sings this to thee: 'Thou single wilt prove none.' IXIs it for fear to wet a widow's eye,That thou consum'st thy self in single life?Ah! if thou issueless shalt hap to die,The world will wail thee like a makeless wife;The world will be thy widow and still weepThat thou no form of thee hast left behind,When every private widow well may keepBy children's eyes, her husband's shape in mind:Look what an unthrift in the world doth spendShifts but his place, for still the world enjoys it;But beauty's waste hath in the world an end,And kept unused the user so destroys it.No love toward others in that bosom sitsThat on himself such murd'rous shame commits. XFor shame deny that thou bear'st love to any,Who for thy self art so unprovident.Grant, if thou wilt, thou art beloved of many,But that thou none lov'st is most evident:For thou art so possessed with murderous hate,That 'gainst thy self thou stick'st not to conspire,Seeking that beauteous roof to ruinateWhich to repair should be thy chief desire.O! change thy thought, that I may change my mind:Shall hate be fairer lodged than gentle love?Be, as thy presence is, gracious and kind,Or to thyself at least kind-hearted prove:Make thee another self for love of me,That beauty still may live in thine or thee. XIAs fast as thou shalt wane, so fast thou grow'stIn one of thine, from that which thou departest;And that fresh blood which youngly thou bestow'st,Thou mayst call thine when thou from youth convertest.Herein lives wisdom, beauty, and increase;Without this folly, age, and cold decay:If all were minded so, the times should ceaseAnd threescore year would make the world away.Let those whom nature hath not made for store,Harsh, featureless, and rude, barrenly perish:Look whom she best endow'd, she gave the more;Which bounteous gift thou shouldst in bounty cherish:She carv'd thee for her seal, and meant thereby,Thou shouldst print more, not let that copy die. XIIWhen I do count the clock that tells the time,And see the brave day sunk in hideous night;When I behold the violet past prime,And sable curls, all silvered o'er with white;When lofty trees I see barren of leaves,Which erst from heat did canopy the herd,And summer's green all girded up in sheaves,Borne on the bier with white and bristly beard,Then of thy beauty do I question make,That thou among the wastes of time must go,Since sweets and beauties do themselves forsakeAnd die as fast as they see others grow;And nothing 'gainst Time's scythe can make defenceSave breed, to brave him when he takes thee hence. XIIIO! that you were your self; but, love, you areNo longer yours, than you your self here live:Against this coming end you should prepare,And your sweet semblance to some other give:So should that beauty which you hold in leaseFind no determination; then you wereYourself again, after yourself's decease,When your sweet issue your sweet form should bear.Who lets so fair a house fall to decay,Which husbandry in honour might uphold,Against the stormy gusts of winter's dayAnd barren rage of death's eternal cold?O! none but unthrifts. Dear my love, you know,You had a father: let your son say so. XIVNot from the stars do I my judgement pluck;And yet methinks I have Astronomy,But not to tell of good or evil luck,Of plagues, of dearths, or seasons' quality;Nor can I fortune to brief minutes tell,Pointing to each his thunder, rain and wind,Or say with princes if it shall go wellBy oft predict that I in heaven find:But from thine eyes my knowledge I derive,And, constant stars, in them I read such artAs truth and beauty shall together thrive,If from thyself, to store thou wouldst convert;Or else of thee this I prognosticate:Thy end is truth's and beauty's doom and date. XVWhen I consider every thing that growsHolds in perfection but a little moment,That this huge stage presenteth nought but showsWhereon the stars in secret influence comment;When I perceive that men as plants increase,Cheered and checked even by the self-same sky,Vaunt in their youthful sap, at height decrease,And wear their brave state out of memory;Then the conceit of this inconstant staySets you most rich in youth before my sight,Where wasteful Time debateth with decayTo change your day of youth to sullied night,And all in war with Time for love of you,As he takes from you, I engraft you new. XVIBut wherefore do not you a mightier wayMake war upon this bloody tyrant, Time?And fortify your self in your decayWith means more blessed than my barren rhyme?Now stand you on the top of happy hours,And many maiden gardens, yet unset,With virtuous wish would bear you living flowers,Much liker than your painted counterfeit:So should the lines of life that life repair,Which this, Time's pencil, or my pupil pen,Neither in inward worth nor outward fair,Can make you live your self in eyes of men.To give away yourself, keeps yourself still,And you must live, drawn by your own sweet skill. XVIIWho will believe my verse in time to come,If it were fill'd with your most high deserts?Though yet heaven knows it is but as a tombWhich hides your life, and shows not half your parts.If I could write the beauty of your eyes,And in fresh numbers number all your graces,The age to come would say 'This poet lies;Such heavenly touches ne'er touch'd earthly faces.'So should my papers, yellow'd with their age,Be scorn'd, like old men of less truth than tongue,And your true rights be term'd a poet's rageAnd stretched metre of an antique song:But were some child of yours alive that time,You should live twice, in it, and in my rhyme. \n                        \n                    ",

LXXXIVWho is it that says most, which can say more,Than this rich praise, that you alone, are you,In whose confine immured is the storeWhich should example where your equal grew?Lean penury within that pen doth dwellThat to his subject lends not some small glory;But he that writes of you, if he can tellThat you are you, so dignifies his story.Let him but copy what in you is writ,Not making worse what nature made so clear,And such a counterpart shall fame his wit,Making his style admired every where.You to your beauteous blessings add a curse,Being fond on praise, which makes your praises worse.
